Gir folder
==========

This folder contains

- the fundamental header `_GirToBac-0.0.bi`
- a translated version of `GLib-2.0.bi`

Both are obligatory in order to compile the projects source code.

The fundamental header is the root of the Gir-headers tree, necessary
for all further headers. (It's a copy of `Gir/_GirToBac-0.0.bi`)

The project is based on the XML parser features in GLib-2.0.bi header.

This folder is for quick testing. Once you installed the header files
from [the Gir header set](https://github.com/DTJF/gir_headers), you
wont need this folder any more.
