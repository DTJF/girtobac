Welcome to project *@PROJ_NAME@*, a tool to generate FreeBASIC (FB)
header files for libraries based on
[GOject-Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/),
which is a middleware layer between C libraries (using GObject) and
language bindings. The C library can be scanned at compile time and
generate a metadata file, in addition to the actual native C library.
*@PROJ_NAME@* can read this metadata and automatically provide FB
bindings to call into the C library.

*@PROJ_NAME@* is the first approach to connect the FreeBasic
programming language to this tool-chain for easy creating and up-dating
FreeBasic header files of GObject based libraries (ie. like GTK, GDA,
GooCanvas, ...).

Find detailed information in the \subpage PagTutorial.

The package is [hosted at GitHub](@PROJ_WEBS@). Find the online
documentation at
http://users.freebasic-portal.de/tjf/Projekte/GirToBac/doc/html/.
