Gir folder
==========

This folder contains

- the fundamental header _GirToBac-0.0.bi
- some control files `*.GirToBac`

The fundamental header is the root of the Gir-headers tree, necessary
for all further headers.

The control files are examples for some input files (same name and suffix `*.gir`), necessary
to fix and/or re-order declarations.
