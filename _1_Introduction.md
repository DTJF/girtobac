This project is about a new header generator for the [FreeBasic
(FB)](http://www.freebasic.net) programming language. It creates FB
headers by scanning `*.gir` files.

`*.gir` files are generated by the
[GObject-Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection)
(GI) technology. GNOME libraries based on GLib/GObject use these
technology to support polyglot application development. This means a
library developed in C can be also used in higher level programming
languages like JavaScript, Python, Vala or others. The GI system helps
to auto-generate bindings for these high-level programming languages.

\Proj is the first attempt to connect FreeBasic (FB) to these supports.
It reads the GI `*.gir` files (generated during compilation of the C
library) and transforms their context to FB headers. Some manual
control is needed to adapt the output. This is done by a configuration
file (one for each `*.gir` file). These configuration files can be
re-used for up-dated `*.gir` files further on.


# How does this work?  {#SecPrinciple}

\Proj is a command line tool, being shipped as FB source code. The code
needs to get compiled first. The executable expects one parameter, the
name of the `*.gir` file (maybe prepended by its relative or absolute
path). It loads this file and additionally a configuration file with
the same base-name and the suffix `.GirToBac` (if present in the
current folder). Then the context of the `*.gir` file gets
translated to FB source by respecting the rules in the configuration
file. The result gets written to the current folder as an FB header
file named after the basename and with suffix `.bi` (overwriting
existent files). In best case the header contains all information to
use the library in FB source code.

The headers are designed to be stored in one directory, one header
for each library (= dll binary). Each header loads the dependencies
its library is based on, so the user need not care about
chaining-up. Just load the highest level header and your source
contains all dependencies (the binaries must have been installed
before).

To generate an FB header the `*.gir` files gets scanned several times:

-# First, some constants get #`DEFINE`d and `TYPE` aliases and
   `ENUM` blocks gets translated.

-# In the second pass `UNION`s, `TYPE`s and callback prototypes are
   done. Some of them are based on others and fbc need to read them
   in the logical order (use the control file to re-order).

-# The last step is to translate static `SUB`s and `FUNCTION`s
   declarations.
